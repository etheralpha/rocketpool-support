If you recently restarted your validator and are missing attestations, it is likely because you have Doppelgänger Detection enabled.

With Doppelgänger Detection, your validator will skip attestations for 1-3 epochs while monitoring the beacon chain to ensure no other validators are currently attesting with your validator keys. This can help prevent you from accidentally getting slashed, either by running multiple validators with the same keys or by switching clients too quickly.

Please wait and see if your attestations resume after a few epochs.
