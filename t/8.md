Since you do not have enough free space to prune, you will have to resync geth's data.

The process is similar to pruning, but will take longer.

To begin, run:
```
rocketpool service resync-eth1
```
and confirm when prompted.

If you're using an infura fallback, you should also run:
```
docker stop rocketpool_node
```
to avoid hitting your free tier limits. This container uses the API but isn't required unless you're launching new minipools or need to auto-claim RPL rewards.

When `rocketpool node sync` shows that eth1 has fully synced (this may take a few days), run `docker start rocketpool_node`.
