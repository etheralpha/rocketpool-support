The main reason for a low peer count is misconfigured port forwarding settings.

Head to [YouGetSignal](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) and test your P2P ports (`9001` and `30303` by default) against your Node's public IP address.

If you're staking from home, the pre-populated IP address is probably correct.
If you're staking from a VPS, enter your node's IP address by hand.

If the ports show as "Closed", you will need to configure port fowarding in your router (or with your VPS provider, if you're not staking from home).

Unfortunately this process is different for each router, and you will have to find instructions specific to your router model.

If your ports show as "Open" and you still have erratic or low peers, the other culprits could be performance issues or bandwidth limitations. Please seek further help on the Rocket Pool Discord.
