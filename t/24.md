Occasionally, we have observed Nodes with conflicting versions of docker installed.

This appears to be the case with you. To resolve this issue, run the following commands:
```
sudo systemctl stop snap.docker.dockerd.service
sudo snap remove --purge docker
sudo systemctl restart docker.socket docker.service
```
