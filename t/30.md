Your UFW settings are preventing Prometheus from accessing the Node-Exporter container, which it needs to do in order to query some metrics.

Please follow [this section of the guides](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/grafana.html#enabling-the-metrics-server) to allow it access: specifically, the yellow "NOTE" box.
