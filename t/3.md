Transactions get stuck in a pending state when the gas settings specified were too low.

You can either wait for gas prices to lower enough and see if the transaction goes through on its own, or [overwrite it](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/cli-intro.html#canceling-overwriting-a-stuck-transaction).

If you decide to overwrite it, you can either speed it up or cancel and resubmit it.
