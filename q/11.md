When you installed Ubuntu, it may not have partitioned the full disk.

Run `lsblk`, and look for a section similar to:
```
└─nvme0n1p3               259:3    0  1.8T  0 part
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0  100G  0 lvm  /
```

Note that the disk capacity is 1.8T, but the volume is only 100G.

Did this happen to you?
